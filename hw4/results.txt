Task 1:
For inner product between two N=4194304 long vectors, I get a CPU bandwidth of 4.426 GB/s and a GPU bandwidth of 5.788 GB/s.
The used CPU was: AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2920 12-Core Processor with 2.2 GHz
The used GPU was: GeForce RTX 2080 Ti
For matrix vector product with matrix dim MxN and vector dim Nx1 with M=512 and N=82944, I get a CPU bandwidth of 2.789 GB/s and a GPU bandwidth of 8.443 GB/s.

Task 2:
Using the CPU we have 648 it/s. Using the GPU we have 24993 it/s. The difference of the resulting solutions is 0.

Task 3:
The first part is done. I have submitted one pull request for Jax. An author asked me to do some corrections regarding my code-style to fit the code base. I am waiting for that to be approved.
In the meantime, I am implementing more numpy functions.
Furthermore, I have started with working with concurrency in jax and get a feeling for that.
