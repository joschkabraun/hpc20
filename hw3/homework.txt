Question 1:


Question 2:
I chose to change sin4_vec() to improve accuracy.

Regarding the extra credit: I described in the source code how to improve the accuracy given the hints. And I did that for sin4_taylor()

Question 3:
I used the architecture on the CIMS serves which is AMD Opteron 63xx class CPU which has 1 core. This explains why the computation time gets more with more threads as the overhead increases. I compied with the -o3 flag.
sequential-scan = 1.704s
parallel-scan with 1 thread = 2.5594s
parallel-scan with 2 threads = 2.2593s
parallel-scan with 4 threads = 2.5861s
error = 0
